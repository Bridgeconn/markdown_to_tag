#he who plants and he who waters are one

Paul speaks of telling people the good news and teaching those who have accepted it as if it were planting and watering plants. He speaks of them being the same work because he considers them equally important, (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#wages

an amount of money that a worker receives for his work

#we

This refers to Paul and Apollos but not the Corinthian church. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

#God's fellow workers

Paul considers himself and Apollos as working together.

#God's garden

God takes care of the Corinthian believers, like someone who tends a garden to make it fruitful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#God's building

God has designed and created the Corinthian believers, like one who constructs a building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
