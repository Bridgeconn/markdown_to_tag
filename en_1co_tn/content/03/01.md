#Connecting Statement:

Paul now reminds the Corinthian believers of how they are actually living instead of behaving as their position before God is. He then reminds them that the person who teaches them is not as important as God who gives their growth.

#brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

#spiritual people

people who obey the Spirit

#fleshly people

people who follow their own desires

#as to babes in Christ

The Corinthians are compared to children very young in age and understanding. AT: "as to very young believers in Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#I fed you milk and not meat

The Corinthians can understand only easy truths like babies who can drink only milk. They are not mature enough to understand greater truths like older children who now can eat solid food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#you are not ready

"you are not ready to understand the harder teachings about following Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
