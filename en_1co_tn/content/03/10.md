#According to the grace of God that was given to me

"According to the task that God freely gave me to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#I laid a foundation

Paul equates his teaching of faith and salvation in Jesus Christ to laying a foundation for a building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#another is building on it

Paul is referring to the person or people who are teaching the Corinthians at that time as if they are carpenters who are constructing the building above the foundation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#let each man

This refers to God's workers in general. AT: "let each person who serves God"

#no one can lay a foundation other than the one that has been laid

This can be stated as active. AT: "I have already laid the only foundation that anyone can lay" or "no one can lay a foundation other than the foundation that I, Paul, laid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
