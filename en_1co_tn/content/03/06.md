#planted

The knowledge of God is compared to a seed which must be planted in order to grow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#watered

As seeds need water, faith needs further teaching in order for it to grow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#growth

As plants grow and develop, so also do faith and knowledge in God also grow and become deeper and stronger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#neither he who plants ... is anything. But it is God who gives the growth

Paul stresses that neither he nor Apollos is responsible for the believers' spiritual growth, but it is God's doing.

#gives the growth

Paul speaks of the ability to grow as though it were a physical object that God could give to plants or to the Corinthians. "enables the plants to grow" or "enables Christians to know him better" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
