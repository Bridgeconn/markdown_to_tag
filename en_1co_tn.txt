#I decided to know nothing ... except Jesus Christ

Paul spoke about the crucifixion of Christ rather than human ideas. AT: "I decided to talk as much as I could ... about Jesus Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])</01><06>#General Information:

#persuasive words of wisdom

Paul now reminds the Corinthian believers of how they are actually living instead of behaving as their position before God is. He then reminds them that the person who teaches them is not as important as God who gives their growth.

#brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

#spiritual people

people who obey the Spirit

#fleshly people

people who follow their own desires

#as to babes in Christ

The Corinthians are compared to children very young in age and understanding. AT: "as to very young believers in Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#I fed you milk and not meat

The Corinthians can understand only easy truths like babies who can drink only milk. They are not mature enough to understand greater truths like older children who now can eat solid food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#you are not ready

"you are not ready to understand the harder teachings about following Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])</01><08>#he who plants and he who waters are one

Paul speaks of telling people the good news and teaching those who have accepted it as if it were planting and watering plants. He speaks of them being the same work because he considers them equally important, (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#wages

an amount of money that a worker receives for his work

#we

This refers to Paul and Apollos but not the Corinthian church. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

#God's fellow workers

Paul considers himself and Apollos as working together.

#God's garden

God takes care of the Corinthian believers, like someone who tends a garden to make it fruitful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#God's building

God has designed and created the Corinthian believers, like one who constructs a building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])</08><18>#Let no one deceive himself

Nobody should believe the lie that he himself is wise in this world.

#in this age

according to the way people who do not believe decide what is wise

#let him become a "fool"

"that person should be willing to have people who do not believe call him a fool" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])

#He catches the wise in their craftiness

God traps the people who think they are clever and uses their own schemes to trap them.

#The Lord knows that the reasoning of the wise is futile

"The Lord knows that what people who think they are wise plan to do is futile"

#futile

useless</18><06>#planted

The knowledge of God is compared to a seed which must be planted in order to grow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#watered

As seeds need water, faith needs further teaching in order for it to grow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#growth

As plants grow and develop, so also do faith and knowledge in God also grow and become deeper and stronger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#neither he who plants ... is anything. But it is God who gives the growth

Paul stresses that neither he nor Apollos is responsible for the believers' spiritual growth, but it is God's doing.

#gives the growth

Paul speaks of the ability to grow as though it were a physical object that God could give to plants or to the Corinthians. "enables the plants to grow" or "enables Christians to know him better" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])</06><21>#you are Christ's, and Christ is God's

Paul speaks of what builders usually do when constructing a building to describe what the teachers in Corinth are actually doing. Builders usually only use gold, silver, or precious stones as decorations on buildings.

#Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw

The building materials used to build a new building are being compared to the spiritual values used to build a person's behavior and activities during his lifetime. AT: "Whether a person builds with valuable materials that will last or with cheap materials that burn easily" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#precious stones

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will show everyone what the builder has done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#for the daylight will reveal it

The "daylight" here is a metaphor for the time when God will judge everyone. When God shows everyone what these teachers have done, it will be like the sun has come up to reveal what happened during the night. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#For it will be revealed in fire. The fire will test the quality of what each one had done

Just as fire will reveal the strengths or destroy the weaknesses of a building, God's fire will judge man's efforts and activities. AT: "God will use fire to  show the quality of his work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])</12><03>#still fleshly

Paul is rebuking the Corinthians. AT: "you should be ashamed because you are living the same way people who do not have the Spirit live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#Who then is Apollos? And who is Paul?

Paul is emphasizing that he and Apollos are not the original source of the gospel, and therefore the Corinthians should not follow them. AT: "It is wrong to form groups to follow Apollos or Paul!" or (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#who is Paul

Paul is speaking of himself as though he is speaking of someone else. "who am I?" or AT: "I am not important!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#Servants through whom you believed

"According to the task that God freely gave me to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#I laid a foundation

Paul equates his teaching of faith and salvation in Jesus Christ to laying a foundation for a building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#another is building on it

Paul is referring to the person or people who are teaching the Corinthians at that time as if they are carpenters who are constructing the building above the foundation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#let each man

This refers to God's workers in general. AT: "let each person who serves God"

#no one can lay a foundation other than the one that has been laid

This can be stated as active. AT: "I have already laid the only foundation that anyone can lay" or "no one can lay a foundation other than the foundation that I, Paul, laid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])</10><16>#Do you not know that you are God's temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?
